There are infinite possibilities to what cool things you can make

- RimWorld & Terraria are my most favorite games ever
- English is my native language but am learning 日本語 (Japanese) myself
- Playing piano is fun
- Dark mode ftw
- Max heaps are cool
- Linked lists are mid
- nvim + tmux are a force to reckon
